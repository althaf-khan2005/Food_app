## Authentication Flow  
1. **Login/Signup**: User enters credentials and taps the login button.  
2. **Auth Gateway**: Determines if the user is logged in and navigates accordingly.  
3. **Home Page**: If login is successful, the user is redirected to the Home Page.  
4. **Logout**: Users can log out using the sign-out button.
